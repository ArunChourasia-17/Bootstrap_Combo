# Bootstrap: Building Better Websites, Faster & efficient.

Bootstrap is a powerful front-end framework that simplifies the process of building responsive and mobile-first websites. Developed by Mark Otto and Jacob Thornton at Twitter, Bootstrap has become one of the most popular frameworks for web development.

## Key Features

1. **Responsive Grid System**: Bootstrap provides a responsive grid system that automatically adjusts the layout of your website based on the screen size and device, ensuring a consistent user experience across desktops, tablets, and smartphones.

2. **Pre-styled Components**: Bootstrap comes with a wide range of pre-styled components such as buttons, forms, navigation bars, and alerts, allowing you to quickly prototype and build user interfaces without writing CSS from scratch.

3. **Customizable Themes**: Bootstrap offers customizable themes and color schemes, making it easy to personalize the look and feel of your website to match your brand or design preferences.

4. **Extensive Documentation**: Bootstrap has comprehensive documentation with examples and code snippets for each component, making it easy for developers to learn and use the framework effectively.

5. **Browser Compatibility**: Bootstrap is compatible with all modern web browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge, ensuring consistent rendering across different platforms.

## Example Code

<!DOCTYPE html>

<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>My Website</title>
    <link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.0-alpha1/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet">
</head>
<body>
    <nav class="navbar navbar-expand-lg navbar-light bg-light">
        <div class="container">
            <a class="navbar-brand" href="#">My Website</a>
            <button class="navbar-toggler" type="button" data-bs-toggle="collapse" data-bs-target="#navbarNav" aria-controls="navbarNav" aria-expanded="false" aria-label="Toggle navigation">
                <span class="navbar-toggler-icon"></span>
            </button>
            <div class="collapse navbar-collapse" id="navbarNav">
                <ul class="navbar-nav">
                    <li class="nav-item">
                        <a class="nav-link active" aria-current="page" href="#">Home</a>
                    </li>
